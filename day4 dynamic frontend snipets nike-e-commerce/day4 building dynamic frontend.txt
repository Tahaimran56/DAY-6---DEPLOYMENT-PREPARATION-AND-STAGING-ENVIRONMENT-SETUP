1. Project Overview

Today’s work focused on enhancing and finalizing key components of the project, including integrating dynamic routing, implementing wishlist functionality, setting up checkout flow, and improving overall application usability.

2. Steps Taken

Navbar Component

Added navigation links for Home, Cart, Wishlist, Products, and Checkout.

Ensured responsive styling with Tailwind CSS.

Product Listing Page

Displayed products dynamically fetched from the API.

Implemented category-based filtering.

Added an Add to Wishlist button for each product.

Product Detail Page

Integrated dynamic routing for individual products under pages/products/[id].

Displayed detailed product information.

Added Add to Cart and Add to Wishlist functionality using Context API.

Fixed routing issues to ensure the page loads correctly.

Wishlist Functionality

Created a WishlistContext for managing wishlist state.

Persisted wishlist data in local storage for future sessions.

Built a wishlist page to display saved items with options to remove them.

Checkout Flow

Developed a multi-step form with sections for:

Billing Address

Shipping Address

Payment Details

Implemented form validation and navigation between steps.

Centralized form data in a single state object.

Reviews and Ratings Component

Added the ability for users to view and submit reviews for individual products.

Dynamically displayed average ratings and user-submitted reviews.

3. Challenges Faced and Solutions

Dynamic Routing Issue

Challenge: The Product Detail Page wasn’t loading due to incorrect folder structure and missing configurations.

Solution: Corrected the file structure under pages/products/[id] and verified dynamic routing logic.

Context API State Management

Challenge: Managing shared states for cart and wishlist.

Solution: Created CartContext and WishlistContext for centralized state management, ensuring seamless data flow across components.

Form Navigation in Checkout Flow

Challenge: Ensuring smooth navigation between multi-step forms while retaining data.

Solution: Stored form data in a centralized state object and validated fields at each step.

4. Key Accomplishments

Successfully implemented a wishlist with persistent state.

Resolved dynamic routing issues for the Product Detail Page.

Built a functional checkout flow with form validation.

Enhanced user experience with responsive design and dynamic components.

Integrated user reviews and ratings for products.

5. Best Practices Followed

Code Organization

Segregated components, context, and API logic for better readability and maintenance.

Responsive Design

Ensured all components are mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS.

Error Handling

Handled API errors gracefully with console messages and user feedback.

Version Control
